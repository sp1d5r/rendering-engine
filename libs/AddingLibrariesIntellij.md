# Adding Libraries for Java 

Since this is my first solo proper Java project, i need to import libraries 
particularly the Light Weight Java Open GL. What i did is the following:
1. Download the Zip from the github [here](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/releases)
2. Extract that from zip
3. Make a new directory Lib 
4. Move all the extracted directories here 
5. Go to File > Project Settings > Library 
6. Click + button 
7. Click on the lib file 
8. Click + again and select all the directories 
9. Press open 
10. Apply 
11. Close :)
